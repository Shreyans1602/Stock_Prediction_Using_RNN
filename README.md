# Machine_Learning_Stock_Prediction_Using_RNN_Project

# Requirements
- The project has two key components to it:
  - Understanding a recent machine learning technique and associated algorithm(s).
  - Apply it to a standard dataset of sufficient complexity. You have to code the main part of the algorithm without using any built-in library. You can use libraries for pre-processing, loading, analysis of results, etc.

- You have to code one or more algorithms from the technique that you have studied on your chosen dataset without using any pre-built library. You are free to use pre-processing and evaluation libraries, but the main algorithm should be coded by you.

- The coding can be done in any language of your choice. Be sure to include instructions on how to compile and run your code.

- You are free to choose a dataset of your choice from sources like Kaggle, or any other source.

- A log file of your experiments (i.e. runs) and parameters should be maintained and submitted. Example of a log file can be:
